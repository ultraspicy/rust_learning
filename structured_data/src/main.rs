/// Quiz this chapter is mostly about remembering the syntax
///     1. how to define a struct and how to use a struct
///     2. how to use specific value from struct
///     3. how to define a function with params and return values
///     4. what is statements and what is expressions
///     5: loop, while and for syntax to write loops
///
///  Things worthy to be mentioned
///     the expression in if statement MUST be a bool
///     multiple branch must have the same type, cuz rust is a static type language
